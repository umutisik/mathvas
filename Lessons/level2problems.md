Making Images
============================================================

Here are some of the trickier problems. You really have to think about how to design your functions for these.

**Fracpart**

@@@ Show hint
You will probably want to use the `floor` and `fromIntegral` functions for this.

**My Chess Board**

Try to make the number of squares on each side into a variable `n`. So that if you write `n=8`, it makes an 8x8 chess board. 

@@@ Show hint
Check the quick reference for the `mod` function. You don't have to use it, but it might help.

**Wobbling chess board**

Notice how the amount of wobble increases as you go to the right.

**Trick**

@@@ Show hint
write `g` and `h` functions, and then make your final answer `f x y = max (g x y) (h x y)`.

**Increase osciallation**

Notice how the oscillation increases as you get closer to the origin. How would you make that happen?
